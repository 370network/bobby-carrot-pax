# A Bobby Carrot Game Clone

Written in:
* Rust ([rust-sdl2](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2))
* Haxe ([heaps.io](https://heaps.io/))
* Zig (:sparkles: [jok](https://github.com/Jack-Ji/jok))

The Rust version is the first try, tested on Linux/MacOS.

The Haxe version is probably the most portable version, tested on WebGL/MacOS(with HashLink)

The Zig version is my favorite, since Zig is fun to write and jok is a nice game engine, tested on Linux (jok is not supprt MacOS yet).
